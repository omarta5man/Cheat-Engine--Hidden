# Cheat Engine (Hidden)


**This is a Cheat Engine version that is hidden from online games (most of them)**
the hex code is edited (using HxD) and every cheat engine sentence is replaced with opera browser

Opera browser has 5 and 6 letters witha space between them
same as cheat engine 5/6 with a space this is why it worked
> note: editing the hex with a sentence that uses less/more letters would crash it or make it detectable
